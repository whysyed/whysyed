Hello! 👋 I’m Syed, and I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can transform everyday life. Growing up, I coded my own OS kernel just to see how far I could push my curiosity. That drive led me to co-found a video-sharing startup (acquired in 2020) 🎉, publish a book on iOS development, and intern at Google, where I built new features for Google Earth 🌍. Now, I’m leading cross-functional teams — designing scalable IoT and GenAI pipelines that turn innovative ideas into real-world impact 🚀.

You’ll often find me digging into open-source projects, writing about the latest tech breakthroughs, or working on some cool models that push boundaries 🤓 🔥 🛠️. I love turning creativity into tangible results, whether it’s hacking together side projects on a late-night coding spree or collaborating on large-scale solutions. If you’re excited about emerging technologies or want to team up on a new idea, let’s connect! 🤝
